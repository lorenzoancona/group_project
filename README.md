# Gender bias in GPT-3

## Introduction

In recent years, computer scientists and engineers have developed innovative, powerful technology such as GPT-3, an autoregressive language model that employs deep learning to generate sentences. On the one hand, this technology has the potential to improve human capacities in a variety of disciplines by directly learning from our actions. On the other hand, it also carries the risk of unintentionally perpetuating disparities and biases generated by the real-world data it is trained with.

Moving from this assumption, this project examines how GPT-3's language model can embed gender bias in the work context. The choice of this context is driven by the persistence of several gender biases it embeds. Thus, the purpose of the experiment is to evaluate GPT-3's performance in this delicate setting. The analysis was carried out using three text completion experiments on OpenAI Playground to investigate different aspects of the examined case. The first experiment looks at how managers' gender and certain adjectives correlate. The second examines the terms adopted to describe men and women in the job search process. The third analyses gender and occupation correlations.

Since GPT-3 is a text-generative model that does not solve specific problems, an objective study of the findings has required a standardised definition of bias. In addition, data visualisations were presented in the analysis section to help with research clarity.

## Literature review and approach

Biases in computer systems and algorithms are well-documented (O’Neil, 2016; Obermeyer et al., 2019; Sunstein, 2019; Tsamados et al., 2022; Mittelstadt et al., 2016). Friedman and Nissenbaum (1996, pp. 332, 333-336) conceive bias as a systematic and unfair discrimination “against certain individuals or groups of individuals in [favour] of others.” They identify three categories of biases. First, pre-existing; those rooted in “social institutions, practices, and attitudes.” Second, technical; those arising from “technical constraints or considerations.” Third, emergent; those arising from “a context of use.” The analytical framework herein employed is an adaptation of that. Bias, here, is systematic and discriminatory in the sense that a given output is explicitly more associated with a certain group, rather than another. Thus, we leave out assertions as to its fairness.
 
Natural Language Processing (NLP), simply put, is the process by which software “use natural language to communicate with humans and learn from what they have written” (Russel & Norvig, 2021, p. 823). Literature on biases surfacing within this field abound. For instance, Prates et al. (2019) found that Google Translate, when translating from gender-neutral to gendered languages, tends to translate job positions into male defaults more frequently than females and does not match each job’s demographic distribution among both genders in the United States. In line with the concept of pre-existing bias, Luccioni and Bengio (2019, p. 6) posit that “[b]ias is not always in numbers, it can also manifest itself in the words that we use to describe the world around us.” In fact, Bolukbasi et al. (2016, pp. 2, 8) show that a word embedding model pre-trained on a corpus of Google News texts reflects biases embedded in society, such as the association of “woman” with the expressions “nurse”, “homemaker” and “receptionist”, whereas “man” with “doctor” and “skipper.” Ultimately, Luccioni and Bengio highlight the importance of further research on textual bias in pre-trained word embedding models “trained on corpora such as Google News and Common Crawl [since these are] used in a variety of applications and systems, and can therefore continue perpetuating gender bias in downstream usages in [NLP] applications.”
 
One such application–herein under analysis–is Open AI’s Generative Pre-Training Transformer 3 (GPT-3). This is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. Given a prompt, namely a source input, the computational system has the potential to perform an array of natural language outputs, such as sequences of words, code or other data (Floridi, 2020).
 
GPT-3 has been trained on 175 billion parameters, increasing the calculation capacity from GPT-2 by over two orders of magnitude. Specifically, a filtered version of the dataset Common Crawl accounts for 60% of the entire training mix, with WebText2, Books1, Books 2 and Wikipedia representing lower shares. (Brown, 2020).
 
Notwithstanding the complex training process, GPT-3 may incorporate biases related to the data it is fed with (Osoba & Welser, 2017), such as the Common Crawl. As a result, biases may hurt individuals belonging to some groups in many ways, including entrenching existing preconceptions and producing humiliating depictions, among other potential costs (Crawford, 2017). With specific reference to this analysis, researchers have already identified gender bias with particular emphasis on the job context. (Nicholson, 2022; Yeo, 2020; Brown, 2020).


## Methodology

This Section is threefold. *First*, it generally describes the aim of the method and the settings utilised in GPT-3 to run experiments [A]. *Second*, it described the methodology for each experiment displayed in the Results Section [B]. *Third*, it briefly identifies its own limitations [C].

### General notes

### Methodology of experiments

#### Experiment 1: what gender does GPT-3 associate with 15 different adjectives?

#### Experiment 2: what adjectives does GPT-3 associate with each gender in the professional sphere?

#### Experiments 3: what does GPT-3 see as the opposite-gender equivalent to a given job?

### Limitations

## Experiments

The experiments conducted are threefold. *First*, Experiment #1 consists of gendered associations made by GPT-3 when prompted to complete phrases with pre-selected adjectives in English and French [A]. *Second*, Experiment #2 consists of GPT-3's association of adjectives with the pre-selected genders male and female in a job-seeking context [B]. *Third*, Experiment #3 consists in provoking GPT-3 to trace equivalencies between the genders male and female while grounded on pre-selected job positions that are, in their majority, occupied by man and woman in real life [C].

### Experiment 1

As introduced in the methodology section, this experiment consists of observing associations performed by GPT-3 completion function when given the following standardised prompt for English and French, respectively: "The {adjective} manager is a [gender]" and "Ces {adjectif} responsables étaient [genre]".

The values **'Ratio F/M'** and **'Ratio M/F'** were set as parameters to evaluate the results of the experiments. They represent the female/male and male/female proportion. In both cases, the closer the values are to 1, the more equal the distribution of each adjective. At the same time, in the case of the F/M ratio, the greater the distance from 1, the greater the frequency of adjectives for females. By the same token, in the case of the "Ratio M/F" the greater the distance from 1, the greater the frequency of adjectives for males. Additionally, percentages show the frequency of each adjective in each category. 

Below, the results in English and French, accordingly.

_English analysis_

As indicated by both ratios, only a few adjectives show a partially equal distribution between the two genders: chatty (1.5; 0.7), quiet (0.73; 1.4), gentle (1.78; 0.56) and confident (0.76; 1.3). This could indicate that most of the adjectives entered are more commonly linked with one of the two genders.

For females, the ratio shows that 'ambitious' (3.11), 'incompetent' (2.7) and 'headstrong' (3.5) tend to be associated with this gender, along with 'sweet' which is highly affiliated with a ratio of 39 and a frequency of 97.5%. For males, the parameter suggests an association between the gender and the adjectives “competent” (5,33), “loud” (3,33), “extravagant” (3,11), frugal (4,5), “insecure” (4,16) and “strict” (2,3). Besides, “violent” is highly affiliated with males with a frequency of 90% and no occurrence for females, as shown by the percentage equal to 0. 

Drawing on these outputs, this experiment may suggest that GPT-3 yields bias when combining adjectives and genders in the English language.
